Roman Catholic leader Pope Francis has passed away at the age of 88, after serving as the highest leader of the Roman Catholic Church for 12 years. His death activates the centuries-old process for the election of a new pope. The pope is considered the head of the Catholic Church and has a direct connection with Jesus Christ, according to Roman Catholic faith. Pope Francis had approved a less complex plan for his own funeral, rejecting the traditional expectations for pope burials. He chose a simple casket made of common wood, twisted together, and requested his body to be kept in an open state to allow the grieving public to pay respects. His body will be entombed outside Vatican City, making him the first pope in over a century to be interred outside of the Vatican. He will rest at the St. Mary Major Basilica, one of the four major Papal basilicas in Rome. The process of electing a new Pope begins with the 252 Catholic cardinals, with 138 eligible to vote due to being under the age of 80. Traditionally, the new pope is introduced via white smoke emitted from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel. Pope Francis, originally from Argentina, was the first pope from South America, elected in 2013. Historically cardinals have mostly selected popes from Europe, particularly Italy, with 217 of the total 266 popes being Italian citizens.

The Daily Star has reported evidence of efforts by the Bangladesh government to cover up medical records and dispose of bodies related to the July uprising. The investigation found seven protest-related unclaimed bodies in the mortuaries at Dhaka Medical College Hospital. In other news, a significant portion of Bangladesh's illegal cigarette industry is reportedly controlled by two companies, majority-owned by Chattogram City Corporation Councillor Abdus Sabur Liton and his brother. Meanwhile, The Daily Star reports that only 27 employees of NRBC Bank received salary increases in 2022, violating banking rules and the bank’s own HR policy. Furthermore, the bank reportedly failed to repatriate at least $3.45 million as per its internal audit findings, and senior management allegedly concealed the trail of the capital flight. In a notable incident in 2016, current Chairman Tamal Parvez and Director Adnan Imam reportedly entered a board meeting with a man wielding a large firearm.
